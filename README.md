##Android Receipt Storage Application

This project was undertaken as part of a Ubiquitous Computing module under Dr. Gregory O'Hare.
This project was completed as part of a team consisting of myself, Jake Kavanagh and Thomas Neville.

As part of the project the following was undertaken:

- Developed a list application that allows users to store items
- Intergrated Google Cloud Vision API for text analysis
- Stored receipts locally using SQLite

## Application Screenshots

Shopping List - Contains entries that the user has added. The bottom button allows the user to items based upon the user's past purchases. The user can also add item by clicking the button in the bottom right. From here the user can add an item by text or take a photo of the item which adds the item to the list.
